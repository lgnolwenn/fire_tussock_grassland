# fire_tussock_grassland
Effects of fire history on plant and soil fungal communities in a tussock grassland.

## Data curation
Files 01 and 02 allow you to prepare plant and fungal data for analyses. Especially, in 01 we calculated the percentage of cover of each subplot for each plant species and in 02 we filtered fungi to get representative results.

## Basic statistics
Files 03 and 04 contain analyses of abiotic and plant-fungal data respectively. In file 04 we calculated richness, diversity and performed Principal coordinate analayses.

## HMSC models
Files 05 to 08 are for modeling the data. Files 05 and 06 are about the responses of plants and fungi simultaneously to fire, in file 05 we designed and ran the model (using a virtual machine), while in file 06 we analysed the outputs of the model. Files 07 and 08 are about the changes of plant cover over time in function of fire histories, in file 07 we designed and ran the model (using a virtual machine), while in file 08 we analysed the outputs of the model.
